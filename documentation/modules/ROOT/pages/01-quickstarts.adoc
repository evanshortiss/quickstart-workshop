[#quickstart_modification]
== 1.2 QuickStart Modifications

Image a situation where we wanted our team to have access to the Bitnami Helm repos, but we don't want to clutter up the menu for other developers by making this content available cluster-wide.  `ProjectHelmChart` resources are the perfect solution when you need per-project or per-team usage of Helm repositories on a cluster.

In this section, we will learn how to modify an existing `ConsoleQuickStart` resource with new instructions.  The resulting `ConsoleQuickStart` resource should install the Bitnami Helm repo (instead of the Azure helm repository).

1. Search for Resource type `ConsoleQuickStarts`
2. Select the item named `install-helmchartrepo-ns`
3. Click on `YAML` to edit the resource
4. On line 96, update the `url` attribute with the Bitnami helm repo address: `https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`
5. Click "Save"

In the next section, the reader will verify that the quickstart has been updated by running a manual test of the modified resource.

[#helm_charts]
=== 1.2.1 Check your work - Helm Charts per project
